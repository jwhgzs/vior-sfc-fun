# About me (the author)
Please allow me to brag about myself...

My English name is Jason Tan, and my Chinese name is 谭镇洋 (Zhenyang, Tan), a 14-year-old boy. I'm a middle school student from China. I'm a boarder so that I can only program at weekends (exclude some special cases like holidays).

I started this project Vior just because I saw a middle school team called [Bug-Duck](https://github.com/Bug-Duck), they made a JS framework [TNT.js](https://github.com/Bug-Duck/tntjs) like Vue, and bragged about it. My internal drive for exellence motivated me to make one on my own. And I searched some data about Vue, learned some core principle of it, then I made it without help in a week overall (8 days from Vior v0.1.0 to v0.2.26). I think I did it!

The whole project, I didn't copy other's codes. I learnt Vue's dependencies traking and virtual DOM's diff algorithm, and other parts I got no any help.

What? Are you surprise with my English? LOL. I try my best to write in English by myself, and I'll use the translator in some special cases. Maybe programming makes my a lot stronger vocabulary and express ability than most middle school students. But I may make some funny language mistakes sometime, so your advice is most welcome!
